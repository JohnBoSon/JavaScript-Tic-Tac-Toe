After seeing WebDevSimplified tutorial of making Tic Tac Toe, I wanted to see if I could remake a 
Tic Tac Toe AI I made back in highschool. Last time I made this AI it would never end a game in a 
loss, the AI would either win or draw. This time I used Java script instead of java and the AI went 
second instead of going first. This AI is not impossible to beat but it chooses the best option and 
is very hard to win against.
